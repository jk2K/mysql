# Migrate data between ApsaraDB RDS for PPAS instances

This topic describes how to use Data Transmission Service \(DTS\) to migrate data between RDS instances. DTS supports schema migration, full data migration, and incremental data migration. When you configure a data migration task, you can select all of the supported migration types to ensure service continuity.

## Prerequisites

The source and destination RDS instances use the same database engines.

## Precautions

-   DTS uses read and write resources of the source and destination databases during full data migration. This may increase the load of the database server. If the database performance is unfavorable, the specification is low, or the data volume is large, database services may become unavailable. For example, DTS occupies a large amount of read and write resources in the following cases: a large number of slow SQL queries are performed on the source database, the tables have no primary keys, or a deadlock occurs in the destination database. Before you migrate data, evaluate the impact of data migration on the performance of the source and destination databases. We recommend that you migrate data during off-peak hours. For example, you can migrate data when the CPU utilization of the source and destination databases is less than 30%.
-   The tables to be migrated in the source database must have PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraints and all fields must be unique. Otherwise, the destination database may contain duplicate data records.
-   To ensure data consistency, do not write data to the source RDS instance during full data migration.
-   If a data migration task fails, DTS automatically resumes the task. Before you switch your workloads to the destination instance, stop or release the data migration task. Otherwise, the data in the source instance will overwrite the data in the destination instance after the task is resumed.

## Billing

|Migration type|Instance configuration fee|Internet traffic fee|
|--------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
|Schema migration and full data migration|Free of charge|Charged only when data is migrated from Alibaba Cloud over the Internet. For more information, see [Pricing]().|
|Incremental data migration|Charged. For more information, see [Pricing]().|

## Migration types

-   Schema migration

    DTS migrates the schemas of the required objects to the destination instance.

-   Full data migration

    DTS migrates historical data of the required objects from the source RDS instance to the destination RDS instance.

-   Incremental data migration

    After full data migration is complete, DTS synchronizes incremental data from the source RDS instance to the destination RDS instance. Incremental data migration allows you to ensure service continuity when you migrate data between RDS instances.

    ![Select the migration types and objects to be migrated](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/8906544061/p47745.png)

    |Parameter|Description|
    |:--------|:----------|
    |Migration Types|Select the migration types based on your business requirements. The migration types must be supported by the database engine.

     -   To perform only full data migration, select **Schema Migration** and **Full Data Migration**.
    -   To ensure service continuity during data migration, select **Schema Migration**, **Full Data Migration**, and **Incremental Data Migration**.
 **Note:** If **Incremental Data Migration** is not selected, do not write data to the source RDS instance during full data migration. This ensures data consistency between the source and destination instances. |
    |Available|Select objects from the Available section and click the ![Right arrow](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/3457359951/p40698.png) icon to move the objects to the Selected section.

 **Note:**

    -   You can select databases, tables, or columns as the objects to be migrated.
    -   After an object is migrated to the destination database, the name of the object remains unchanged. You can use the object name mapping feature to change the names of the objects that are migrated to the destination database. For more information, see [Object name mapping](/intl.en-US/Data Migration/Migration task management/Object name mapping.md).
    -   If you use the object name mapping feature on an object, other objects that are dependent on the object may fail to be migrated. |

8.  In the lower-right corner of the page, click **Precheck**.

    **Note:**

    -   Before you can start the data migration task, a precheck is performed. You can start the data migration task only after the task passes the precheck.
    -   If the task fails to pass the precheck, click the ![Info icon](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/3457359951/p47468.png) icon next to each failed item to view details. Troubleshoot the issues based on the causes and run the precheck again.
9.  After the task passes the precheck, click **Next**.
10. In the Confirm Settings dialog box, specify the **Channel Specification** and select **Data Transmission Service \(Pay-As-You-Go\) Service Terms**.
11. Click **Buy and Start** to start the migration task.
    -   Full data migration

        Do not manually stop a task during full data migration. Otherwise, data migrated to the destination database will be incomplete. Wait until the migration task automatically stops.

    -   Incremental data migration

        An incremental data migration task does not automatically stop. You must manually stop the migration task.

        **Note:** Select an appropriate time to manually stop the migration task. For example, you can stop the migration task during off-peak hours or before you switch your workloads to the destination instance.

        1.  Wait until **Incremental Data Migration** and **The migration task is not delayed** appear in the progress bar of the migration task. Then, stop writing data to the source database for a few minutes. The delay time of **incremental data migration** may be displayed in the progress bar.
        2.  After the status of **incremental data migration** changes to **The migration task is not delayed**, manually stop the migration task.
