# INTERSECT operators

This topic describes the INTERSECT operators. These operators are used to check whether the bounding box of the left operand-specified object intersects with the bounding box of the right operand-specified object in a specified dimension.

## Syntax

```
{geometry, trajectory, boxndf} /&/ {geometry, trajectory, boxndf}
{trajectory, boxndf} #&# {trajectory, boxndf}
{geometry, trajectory, boxndf} && {geometry, trajectory, boxndf}
{geometry, trajectory, boxndf} &/& {geometry, trajectory, boxndf}
{trajectory, boxndf} &#& {trajectory, boxndf}
{trajectory, boxndf} &/#& {trajectory, boxndf}
```

## Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|Left operand|The object whose bounding box you want to compare.|
|Right operand|The object whose bounding box you want to compare.|

## Description

The INTERSECT operators allow you to check whether the bounding box of the left operand-specified object intersects with the bounding box of the right operand-specified object in a specified dimension. These bounding boxes are generated by the ST\_MakeBox function. For more information, see [ST\_MakeBox](/intl.en-US/Spatio-temporal Database/Trajectory SQL reference/Functions to process bounding boxes/ST_MakeBox.md).

The following INTERSECT operators are supported:

-   `/&/`: checks whether the bounding boxes of two objects intersect in the z dimension.
-   `#&#`: checks whether the bounding boxes of two objects intersect in the t dimension.
-   `&&`: checks whether the bounding boxes of two objects intersect in the x and y dimensions.
-   `&/&`: checks whether the bounding boxes of two objects intersect in the x, y, and z dimensions.
-   `&#&`: checks whether the bounding boxes of two objects intersect in the x, y, and t dimensions.
-   `&/#&`: checks whether the bounding boxes of two objects intersect in the x, y, z, and t dimensions.

## Example

```
WITH box AS(
    SELECT ST_MakeBox3d(0,0,0,5,5,5) a,
           ST_MakeBox3dt(6,6, 3,'2010-04-12 00:00:00',8,8,5,'2013-02-01 00:00:00') b
)
SELECT a /&/ b AS OpZ, a #&# b AS OpT, a && b AS Op2D, a &/& b AS Op3d, a &#& b AS Op2DT, a &/#& b AS Op3DT from box;
 opz | opt | op2d | op3d | op2dt | op3dt 
-----+-----+------+------+-------+-------
 t   | t   | f    | f    | f     | f
            
```
