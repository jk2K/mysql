# INCLUDED operators

This topic describes the INCLUDED operators. These operators are used to check whether the bounding box of the left operand-specified object is included in the bounding box of the right operand-specified object in a specified dimension.

## Syntax

```
{geometry, trajectory, boxndf} /<@/ {geometry, trajectory, boxndf}
{trajectory, boxndf} #<@# {trajectory, boxndf}
{geometry, trajectory, boxndf} <@ {geometry, trajectory, boxndf}
{geometry, trajectory, boxndf} </@ {geometry, trajectory, boxndf}
{trajectory, boxndf} <#@ {trajectory, boxndf}
{trajectory, boxndf} </#@ {trajectory, boxndf}
```

## Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|Left operand|The object whose bounding box you want to compare.|
|Right operand|The object whose bounding box you want to compare.|

## Description

The INCLUDED operators allow you to check whether the bounding box of the left operand-specified object is included in the bounding box of the right operand-specified object in a specified dimension. These bounding boxes are generated by the ST\_MakeBox function. For more information, see [ST\_MakeBox](/intl.en-US/Spatio-temporal Database/Trajectory SQL reference/Functions to process bounding boxes/ST_MakeBox.md). The effect of the INCLUDED operators is opposite to that of the INCLUDE operators. For more information, see [t1950312.md\#]().

The following INCLUDED operators are supported:

-   `/<@/`: checks whether the bounding box of the left operand-specified object is included in the bounding box of the right operand-specified object in the z dimension.
-   `#<@#`: checks whether the bounding box of the left operand-specified object is included in the bounding box of the right operand-specified object in the t dimension.
-   `<@`: checks whether the bounding box of the left operand-specified object is included in the bounding box of the right operand-specified object in the x and y dimensions.
-   `<&@`: checks whether the bounding box of the left operand-specified object is included in the bounding box of the right operand-specified object in the x, y, and z dimensions.
-   `<#@`: checks whether the bounding box of the left operand-specified object is included in the bounding box of the right operand-specified object in the x, y, and t dimensions.
-   `</#@`: checks whether the bounding box of the left operand-specified object is included in the bounding box of the right operand-specified object in the x, y, z, and t dimensions.

## Example

```
WITH box AS(
    SELECT ST_MakeBox3dt(0,0,0, '2010-01-01 00:00:00',10,10,10, '2012-01-01 00:00:00') a,
           ST_MakeBox3dt(6,6,3,'2010-01-01 00:00:00',8,8,5,'2013-01-01 00:00:00') b
)
SELECT b /<@/ a AS OpZ, b #<@# a AS OpT, b <@ a AS Op2D, b </@ a AS Op3D, b <#@ a AS Op2DT, b </#@ a AS Op3DT from box;
 opz | opt | op2d | op3d | op2dt | op3dt 
-----+-----+------+------+-------+-------
 t   | f   | t    | t    | f     | f
```
